            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>I've worked as a mechanical engineer for mining contractor Thiess for over 10 years. In 2015, we created our very own
                component rebuild centre, for which all of our processes, tools, documentation, etc. were built from the ground
                up.</p>
            <p>Thiess have been a wonderful employer to work for and I've had the pleasure to work closely with a group of 
                wonderful, funny, hard-working people over the years.</p>
