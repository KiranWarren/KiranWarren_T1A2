            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
              I've worked as a mechanical engineer for mining contractor Thiess
              for over 10 years. In 2015, we created our very own component
              rebuild centre, for which all of our processes, tools,
              documentation, etc. were built from the ground up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thiess have been a wonderful employer to work for and I've had the
              pleasure to work closely with a group of wonderful, funny,
              hard-working people over the years.

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>My family is my partner, Mina, and my daughter, Amelia.</p>
            <p>
              We love music! Mina is a piano teacher, I play guitar and my
              daughter is learning drums and piano.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also love travelling together, eating new/interesting foods and
              chilling out at the beach.

            <p>
              Cricket - Love watching the Aussies play. I also back the Heat and
              the Scorchers in the BBL.
            </p>
            <p>
              Golf - I have recently taken up golf. If the aim of golf was to
              get the highest score, then I would turn pro.
            </p>
            <p>
              Music - My brain is full of useless metal trivia. I play guitar in
              my spare time and do some home recording.
